# startup_automatisation
Automatisation of my startup's computer

##note
It works **_only_** on linux !

## You need to :
- allow the execution of both files
- change the applications you want to open on the _launching.sh_ file
- change the _launching.sh_ file's path on the main.py file
- put the _main.py_ file on your startup applications.
