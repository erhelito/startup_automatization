# Startup automatization
Automatization of my computer's startup

## Note
It works **_only_** on linux !

## You need to :
- allow the execution of both files
- change the applications you want to open on the _launching.sh_ file
- put the _main.py_ file on your startup applications.

## Files history (see branches)
- Archive1 : auto path for the _launching.py_'s launching
