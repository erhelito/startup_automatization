# Startup automatization
Automatization of my computer's startup

## Note
It works **_only_** on linux !

## You need to :
- install tkinter, with ``sudo apt-get install python3-tk``
- allow the execution of _installation.py_
- execute it
- change the applications you want to open on the _launching.sh_ file
- put the _main.py_ file on your startup applications.
